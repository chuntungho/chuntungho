Single responsibility principle {#singleresponsibilityprinciple}
----------------------------------------------------------------

A class should **only have a single responsibility**, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.

Open--closed principle {#openclosedprinciple}
---------------------------------------------

"Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification." that is, such an entity can allow its behaviour to be extended **without modifying its source code**.

Liskov substitution principle {#liskovsubstitutionprinciple}
------------------------------------------------------------

"Objects in a program should be **replaceable with instances of their subtypes** without altering the correctness of that program."

Interface segregation principle {#interfacesegregationprinciple}
----------------------------------------------------------------

"Many **client-specific** interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."

Dependency inversion principle {#dependencyinversionprinciple}
--------------------------------------------------------------

One should "**depend upon abstractions**, not concretions."
